// mqsConductorLoss can export its solution for plotting (opts.returnField).
// See FORK_CHANGES.md for the full list of changes.
//
// Magneto-quasi-static (MQS) volume eddy-current conductor loss.
//
// Solves the 2D skin-effect problem with the conductor interior meshed at finite σ
// — the same physics as Ansys 2D Extractor's RL solve. No Leontovich/SIBC
// assumption, no PEC-field singular boundary integral: corners are handled by the
// actual current distribution. Requires a mesh generated with
// generateGmshMesh({..., meshConductorInterior: true}).
//
// Formulation (A_z, e^{jωt}, quasi-TEM so the H pattern is ε-independent):
//   signal:     ∇²A − jωμ₀σ·A + μ₀σ·C = 0     J = σ(C − jωA), C = −dV/dz (V/m)
//   ground rect: ∇²A − jωμ₀σ·A = 0            J = −jωσA (passive return/eddy)
//   dielectric: ∇²A = 0
//   ground y=0 and outer walls: A = 0 (perfect ground; its loss is added
//   perturbatively with the flat-surface skin formula — exact for a plane).
//   Symmetry plane (condRect.symmetry > 1): natural BC at x = xmin_domain.
//
// Explicit ground rects (coplanar GCPW grounds, via-fence slabs, ground-cutout
// remnants) are return conductors tied to the reference at both line ends, so
// their per-unit-length voltage gradient is C = 0: they get finite σ (the jωμ₀σ
// mass term) but no source term, and the induced return current splits between
// them and the PEC boundary walls by the field solution itself. The roles come
// from condRect.rectRoles (is_signal), without rectRoles every rect is driven.
//
// The problem is linear in the single drive C: solve K*A1 = μ₀σ*Fc once with
// C = 1 (K = S + jωμ₀σ*M, complex symmetric, K^T = K not Hermitian, Fc spans
// the signal rects only), then scale C so the total signal current equals I.
// K is factorized as is by the WASM complex-symmetric LDL^T (solveComplexSymmetric,
// see solve_complex_symmetric in eigen_solver.cpp): S is SPD and βM positive
// semidefinite, so no pivoting is needed. Solutions travel as [Ar; Ai], the N
// real parts followed by the N imaginary parts.
//
// Per-conductor drives (opts.modeCurrents): a differential pair with no
// symmetry walls, or asymmetric pair, cannot use the single shared drive: both
// traces would act as a parallel conductor. Instead the signal rects are
// grouped by polarity (one group per net), each group gets its own drive C_k,
// and linearity gives A = Σ C_k*A_k from one unit solve per group (same
// factorization, solveComplexSymmetric takes all RHS at once). The small NxN current
// matrix D_jk = σ(δ_jk*area_j - jω*Fc_j*A_k) maps drives to net currents,
// solving D*C = I_target realizes the requested mode currents (+1/-1 odd, +1/+1
// even, or the modal current vector for an asymmetric pair).

//   Z0          — (optional) line impedance for α_c conversion
//   opts.wallPEC — {left,right,top,bottom} flags saying which domain walls are metal
//   (from the mesher. `left` is already cleared on a half domain so the symmetry
//   plane is never counted). Only these walls contribute to the wall loss, every
//   wall is Dirichlet in the solve regardless. Omit it and the legacy behaviour
//   applies: bottom always, top per opts.topGround, sides never.
//   opts.topGround — legacy fallback for opts.wallPEC.top (stripline)
//   opts.oddSymmetry — odd-mode symmetry: A = 0 (Dirichlet) on the symmetry plane
//   x = xmin_domain instead of the natural (even-mode) BC. For a centered
//   differential pair meshed as a half domain with one full trace, this solves
//   the odd mode; the default natural BC solves the even mode.
//   opts.modeCurrents — per-conductor-drive path (full domain only): array of
//   target net currents, one per signal polarity group (positive-polarity group
//   first, pre.groups order). Use [1, -1] for the odd mode, [1, 1] for even, or
//   the modal current vector (normalized to Σ|I|^2 = 2) for an asymmetric pair.
//   Replaces the symmetry-plane mode selection: broadside/asymmetric pairs and
//   symmetry-disabled solves get a per-mode MQS answer instead of the
//   perturbation fallback. R_total/X_total keep the differential convention
//   (both traces, per-line mode R = R_total/2), L_loop is per-line.
//   opts.Rq — RMS surface roughness (m), gradient model (single layer, same Rq on
//   all surfaces). The dissipation is scaled by Ψ_R(f) = Re(Z_rough)/Rs and the
//   loop inductance gets the matching surface-reactance increment
//   ΔL = (Im(Z_rough) − Rs)/ω · ∮|K|², with ∮|K|² from the volume R, keeping
//   R(f)/L(f) causal. With a single Rq the per-surface factor is uniform, so
//   scaling the smooth-σ dissipation is exact in the skin regime (t ≫ δ) and
//   degrades gracefully to the correct DC limit (Ψ → 1 as δ grows).
//   opts.surfaceZs(x, y, orient) — OPTIONAL per-face surface impedance {re,im} at a
//   face midpoint (orient 'h' = top/bottom, 'v' = side), for per-side plating. The
//   smooth trace (and ground) loss is scaled by the |K|²-weighted average of
//   Re(Zs_face)/Rs over the faces — generalizing the uniform Ψ_R. The weights come
//   from the MQS smooth current distribution (corner-regularized, unlike a
//   perturbation surface integral). Reduces exactly to the uniform factor when
//   every face shares one Zs. Takes precedence over Rq when provided.
// Returns { R_trace, R_gnd, R_total, X_total, L_loop, alpha_c, alpha_c_dBm, delta, nDofs }
// L_loop is the series inductance from Im(Z_pul) = ωL — includes trace internal
// inductance and ground-current spreading (ground itself is PEC here).
// X_total is the surface REACTANCE per unit length, the twin of R_total: the same
// |K|²-weighted surface integral taken against Im(Zs) where R_total takes Re(Zs). It is
// what the caller builds the internal inductance from (X_total/ω), because L_loop −
// L_external cancels two large near-equal numbers and loses it. Smooth metal has
// Zs = Rs(1 + j), so X_total === R_total there and only rough/plated surfaces separate
// them (Im(Zs)/Re(Zs) reaches ~5 at 1 µm rms). Same differential convention as R_total.
// Frequency-INVARIANT part of the MQS solve on a given mesh: conductor
// classification, DOF map, the S (everywhere) / M, Fc (conductor) assembly, and
// the symbolic CSR with separate S / M value templates. The system is
// K = S + jβM with β = ωμ₀σ the ONLY frequency-dependent piece, so per frequency
// the values are just valRe = valS, valIm = β·valM on a fixed pattern. Cached by
// the caller (opts.cache) per (mesh, oddSymmetry) — the skin mesh is reused
// across sweep points (f_max-reuse), and re-assembling it every point used to
// dominate the MQS path's JS time.
